# AnimateAI System Design

## Implementation approach

Based on the PRD requirements, we will implement a hybrid architecture that leverages multiple free AI services and Google Colab integration to provide a seamless image-to-video animation experience without direct costs to users. The implementation will follow a layered approach:

1. **Frontend Layer**: A React-based web application with Tailwind CSS that provides an intuitive user interface for image uploading, animation configuration, and result viewing.

2. **Backend Service Layer**: A lightweight Node.js Express server that handles request coordination, load balancing across different AI services, and manages the processing queue.

3. **AI Integration Layer**: A service adapter pattern to integrate multiple AI services (Stable Video Diffusion, Pika Labs API, etc.) and Google Colab notebook execution for more advanced processing.

4. **File Storage Layer**: Temporary cloud storage for processing files and completed animations, with automatic cleanup to minimize costs.

The core architecture will be designed with flexibility and fault tolerance as primary considerations, implementing fallback mechanisms when primary AI services are unavailable or rate-limited.

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **AI Service Integration Strategy**:
   - Primary: Stable Video Diffusion via Hugging Face API (open-source)
   - Secondary: Rotation between free-tier services (Pika Labs, ClipDrop)
   - Advanced: Google Colab notebook execution for custom animations

2. **Processing Architecture**:
   - Queue-based processing system to manage concurrent requests
   - Service rotation to maximize free tier usage across multiple services
   - Adaptive selection of AI service based on animation style and quality needs

3. **Scalability Approach**:
   - Stateless design to allow horizontal scaling of the web service
   - Distributed processing across multiple AI services to handle increased load
   - Cache common animation styles and techniques to improve performance

4. **Error Handling and Reliability**:
   - Circuit breaker pattern for failing AI services
   - Automatic retry with fallback options when primary services fail
   - User notification system for processing status and issues

### Open Source Libraries and Frameworks

1. **Frontend**:
   - React (UI framework)
   - Tailwind CSS (styling)
   - React Query (data fetching and caching)
   - React Dropzone (file uploads)
   - FFmpeg WASM (client-side video processing)

2. **Backend**:
   - Express.js (web server)
   - Bull (Redis-based queue system)
   - Axios (HTTP client for API calls)
   - Multer (file upload handling)
   - node-colab (Google Colab notebook execution)

3. **AI & Processing**:
   - Transformers.js (for client-side AI capabilities)
   - ffmpeg-core (video transcoding and optimization)
   - Sharp (image processing and optimization)

## Data structures and interfaces

The system will use the following core data structures and interfaces to manage the image-to-video animation process:
